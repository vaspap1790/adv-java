     * Dependency Injection
     * Makes a class independent of its dependencies.
     * It achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation.
     * Helps you to follow SOLID's dependency inversion and single responsibility principles
     * This way dependencies can be used and tested independently
     * Three types:
     * - Constructor Injection (Recommended)
     * - Setter Injection (hidden dependency may lead to null pointers)
     * - Field Injection (same problems apply + adds complexity because needs mutation or reflection)
